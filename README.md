# Screenshotter Container
A container for doing automatic screenshotting with Principia. It builds a screenshotter build of Principia inside of an Alpine Linux container that is (primarily) used for taking screenshots of community levels.

Powered by Docker, which I've originally been sceptical about but ever since I saw how adorable [their mascot](mobydock.webp) is I am all for using Docker (so cute!).
